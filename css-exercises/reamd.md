# CSS Conecpts and Basics

### (1) What are the ways of linking stylesheet to HTML file?
so there are three ways : Inline - Internal - External. in Inline method, we can just go inside the tag of the element you want to style and then declare a style property there. In Internal method, we go to the head section of HTML and then there, we declare all our style properties using classes, IDs, tags etc. In external method, we create a different file of .CSS and then link it inside the head of HTML using Link tag. but if all this methods are applied all at once, then in execution Inline will precede over Internal which will precede over External.
