# Basic Web Theories
## Foundation of Internet
- **_Packets_** : when we request a big size of data (videos/images) from a far stored server over internet it doesn’t come as a whole in one single way to our devices. To avoid traffic issues it gets divided in multiple bits and sent to us through multiple routes and then when all the bits reached our devices, they gets arranged in proper order to form the original content. those bits are called <b style="color:pink">Packets</b>.
- But suppose multiple devices are requesting different datas over the same internet source then how can we protect packets from being misplaced with some one other’s packets. the soluition is a combination of Router, IP Adress and MAC Adress. and the whole process is about wrapping and un-wrapping infortmation and information request everytime it reaches a traffic point in the internet route.
- **_DNS_** : <b style="color:darkred">Domain Name System</b> It converts a website name/adress into an IP adress through which that website can have an unique identity in the ocean of internet.

- _**What is CLI?**_ - Command Line Interface is way of coding which enables us to check some input, outputs and functionalities of our code in an interpreter like Terminal or Shell. You can’t do much using CLI, so we can say that it is sort of restricted for developer only use especially for testing and debugging.
## HTML Basics
- **_Absolute Links_** - Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links.
- **_Relative Links_** - Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links.
- **_Semantic HTML_** - Semantic HTML is a principle in Coding which says that every content we put in our HTML should be under right tag. for an example if we are putting footer then all the footer contents should go under the footer tag. same goes for header, label and so on. now there is a mis conception here, that putting a wrong tag and a good ID or class will make it semantic, but no it doesn’t. It is important for the accessibility point of view of the website. 
- The most important text/tittle of a component should wrapped arround **HEADING** tag.
- **_Differences between Semantic and Non-Semantic HTML with examples_** - semantic version of HTML will give meaning to every element present on the document when someone screen reads the webpage. and Non-semantic version of HTML won’t give any meaning. some semantic examples can be : section, aside, footer, header, table, form. and one non-semantic example will be : div or span.
