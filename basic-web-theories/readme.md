# Basic Web Theories
## Foundation of Internet
- **_Packets_** : when we request a big size of data (videos/images) from a far stored server over internet it doesn’t come as a whole in one single way to our devices. To avoid traffic issues it gets divided in multiple bits and sent to us through multiple routes and then when all the bits reached our devices, they gets arranged in proper order to form the original content. those bits are called <b style="color:pink">Packets</b>.
- But suppose multiple devices are requesting different datas over the same internet source then how can we protect packets from being misplaced with some one other’s packets. the soluition is a combination of Router, IP Adress and MAC Adress. and the whole process is about wrapping and un-wrapping infortmation and information request everytime it reaches a traffic point in the internet route.
- **_DNS_** : <b style="color:darkred">Domain Name System</b> It converts a website name/adress into an IP adress through which that website can have an unique identity in the ocean of internet.
## HTML Basics
- **_Absolute Links_** - Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links.
- **_Relative Links_** - Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links.
